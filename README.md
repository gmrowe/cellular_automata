# game_of_life

This is a little Game of Life kata implemented in Rust inspired by the
requirements listed here: https://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/

### Executing

If cargo is installed on your system then the program can be invoked by
cloning the repo and entering:
```
cargo run
```
from the root directory of the project.

Currently the starting state and number of generations is hardcoded in the
main() function of main.rs.
